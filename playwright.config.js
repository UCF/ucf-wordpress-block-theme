/**
 * Playwright configuration for the accessibility suite.
 *
 * CONTEXT: three viewports, carried over from the UCF Brand Block Theme. This theme has no
 * breakpoint of its own yet, but core does: `core/columns` stacks below 782px, so the tablet
 * project (780) audits the stacked layout and the desktop one the side-by-side. The mobile
 * project is the reflow floor (WCAG 1.4.10 asks for 320 CSS px; 360 is the narrowest common
 * device). When the theme adds a breakpoint, put a viewport on each side of it.
 *
 * Browser: set `PW_CHANNEL=chrome` to drive a locally installed Chrome and skip Playwright's
 * ~300MB browser download. CI leaves it unset and runs `npx playwright install chromium`.
 *
 * `TEST_BASE_URL` points the suite somewhere other than wp-env. Note that the content the
 * specs expect comes from `tests/a11y/seed.php`, so an arbitrary site will not have it.
