/**
 * Word-processor characters that survive a paste.
 *
 * Copy from Word, Google Docs or a PDF and the text arrives carrying characters that look
 * like ordinary spaces in the editor and are not: a narrow no-break space where a plain
 * space belongs, a word joiner welding two words together, a stray byte-order mark. Nothing
 * in the editor shows them, so an author cannot see what to fix, and they reach the page.
 *
 * What that looks like on the front end, measured on a real section page carrying 191 of
 * them: `<strong>Goals:U+202F</strong> Clearly define…` renders a doubled gap after the
 * label, because U+202F is not collapsible whitespace and the ordinary space after it is —
 * two spaces, one of which HTML will not fold. And `objectivesU+202F(brand awareness` is a
 * space too narrow to read as one, which the browser may not break at, so a long phrase can
 * push past its column.
 *
 * The mapping is deliberately small, and what it leaves alone matters as much as what it
 * changes — see ucf_theme_paste_artifacts() for the reasoning per character.
 *
 * Two boundaries, because one alone is not enough:
 *
 * - **On save**, so the characters never reach the database from an editor session. This is
 *   the closest the theme can get to catching the paste itself: Gutenberg's raw-handling
 *   pipeline runs a fixed list of filters and exposes no hook to add one, so there is nowhere
 *   to intervene on the clipboard. `wp_insert_post_data` is the next boundary the content
 *   crosses, and unlike a paste handler it also covers imports, the REST API and WP-CLI.
 * - **On display**, because the archive already holds them. One section page carries 191, and
 *   they stay until something rewrites the row. Cleaning on render fixes every page now
 *   rather than as each is next edited.
 *
 * `tools/paste-artifacts.php` is the third piece: it reports what is already stored, and
 * rewrites it on request.

/**
 * The substitution table: what a pasted document leaves behind, and what it should be.
 *
 * Two groups. The first are spaces that are not spaces — they take a normal space, which is
 * collapsible, breakable and the width the copy was set in. The second are zero-width
 * formatting characters that carry no meaning in prose and are simply dropped.
 *
 * Three near neighbours are deliberately absent:
 *
 * - U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE is authored on purpose. `&nbsp;` is a legitimate editorial tool
 *   for holding "Section 3" or a unit on one line, and this theme's own patterns use it.
 * - U+200C / U+200D, the zero-width non-joiner and joiner, are *load-bearing*. A ZWJ is what
 *   makes a multi-part emoji one glyph, and both are letters' worth of meaning in Arabic and
 *   several Indic scripts. Stripping them corrupts text rather than cleaning it.
 * - U+00AD SOFT HYPHEN is invisible until a line breaks there, which is what it is for.
