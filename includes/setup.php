/**
 * Open the page editor with the template rendered around the content.
 *
 * Pages default to `post-only` in core, which hides everything the template supplies —
 * including the page header — so an author never sees it while writing. `template-locked`
 * is the "Show template" state: the template renders, every block in it is disabled, and
 * core re-enables exactly `core/post-title`, `core/post-featured-image` and
 * `core/post-content` (see `DisableNonPageContentBlocks` in @wordpress/editor). The header
 * is therefore visible *and* its title stays editable in place.
 *
 * Two consequences worth knowing:
 *
 * - This is a default, not a lock. The per-user preference (`core` → `renderingModes` →
 *   stylesheet → post type) wins, so an author who switches "Show template" off stays off.
 * - It follows that anything meant to be editable must live in `templates/page.html`
 *   directly. Template parts and their children are disabled outright in this mode.
