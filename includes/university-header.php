 * file is deliberately the whole integration: put the script on the page with the id it
 * looks itself up by, and leave it an empty div to fill.

 * run, so anything that postpones it buys a paint with no header followed by a 50px jump.

 * WordPress `?ver=` would be *this site's* version stamped onto someone else's asset, and
