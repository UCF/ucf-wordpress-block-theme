/**
 * Turn a Playwright run into the accessibility comment posted on a pull request.
 *
 * Reads the JSON report, pulls the structured axe data each test attached (see
 * `tests/a11y/axe.js`), and writes Markdown to stdout.
 *
 *     node tools/a11y-report.js playwright-report/results.json > comment.md
 *
 * **Grouped by finding, not by test.** The raw run is misleading in a specific way: anything
 * shared — a template's markup, a composition's link color — is on many pages at three
 * viewports, so one bad grey fails dozens of tests. A per-test list reads as dozens of problems
 * and buries the count that matters, which is one. So identical (rule, selector, colors)
 * findings collapse into a single row carrying the number of pages it appears on.
 *
 * The audience is the person who has to fix it, and for contrast that is usually a designer
 * rather than a developer. Hence the measured ratio, the two hex values and the required
 * threshold in the table itself — enough to answer "what should this be instead?" without
 * cloning the repository or running anything.
 *
 * Exit code is always 0. The suite's own result is what fails the build; a reporting script
 * that can fail the build would mean a formatting bug hides a green run.
