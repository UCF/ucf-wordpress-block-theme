/**
 * Run the accessibility suite, and always leave the environment stopped.
 *
 * Three steps that have to happen in order and cannot be a `&&` chain: boot wp-env, seed the
 * fixture content, run Playwright. Left running, wp-env holds ports 8888 and 8889 plus four
 * containers, which is how you end up unable to start a *different* project's wp-env with
 * nothing but "address already in use" to go on. So this guarantees four things a chained npm
 * script does not, reliably, across shells:
 *
 * 1. Playwright's exit code is what the process exits with, so CI and `&&` chains see a real
 *    pass or fail rather than the exit code of `wp-env stop`.
 * 2. The environment is stopped even when the tests fail — the common case, and exactly when
 *    a `&&` chain would skip the cleanup.
 * 3. It is stopped on Ctrl-C and on an uncaught exception, rather than orphaning containers.
 *    See the note on the `exit` handler below for why both routes are needed.
 * 4. A teardown that itself fails says so, loudly, instead of leaving you to discover it
 *    the next time some other project will not start.
 *
 * Plus one specific to this tier:
 *
 * **The seed must not be skipped, and a failed seed must not run the tests anyway.** The
 * pages the suite audits are generated, so a stale seed audits the previous run's content and
 * a missing one audits nothing. `tests/a11y/manifest.js` refuses to run without a manifest,
 * which covers the missing case; this covers the stale one by reseeding every time.
 *
 * Run with `npm run test:a11y`. Arguments are passed through to Playwright, so
 * `npm run test:a11y -- --project=desktop tests/a11y/variants.spec.js` works.
 *
 * While iterating, the boot and seed are around ninety seconds of pure overhead. Use
 * `npm run env:start && npm run env:seed` once, then `npm run test:a11y:only` in a loop.

/*
 * Activating the theme is its own WP-CLI invocation, and it has to be.
 *
 * `switch_theme()` writes an option; it does not retrofit the running request. WordPress has
 * already booted by the time `eval-file` gets control — `functions.php` loaded for whatever
 * theme was active, `init` fired, pattern and block-style registration done. Calling
 * `switch_theme()` from inside the seed therefore leaves this process looking at empty
 * registries while making the theme active for the *next* one.
 *
 * That is worse than it sounds. The seed fails on a clean environment and passes on every run
 * after it, so it is green on any machine that has run it once and red on every CI runner.
 * FIX: it shipped exactly that way in the UCF Brand Block Theme, where this rig came from; see
 * tests/README.md.
 *
 * A separate `wp theme activate` means the process below starts with the theme already loaded.
 * An integration tier, when one lands, can solve it from the other side instead — switching
 * at `muplugins_loaded`, before the theme loads.
