 * pattern added to `patterns/` or a style added to `includes/block-styles.php` turns into a
 * test on the next seed with nothing here to update.
 *
 * A missing manifest is a hard error, not an empty run. Playwright reports "0 tests" as a
 * pass, so a forgotten seed would look exactly like a site with nothing wrong with it.

	 * apart. `features` holds markup no template or pattern renders yet — the Section band and
	 * the badges today — so it empties out as patterns start carrying them, and requiring a row
	 * would turn better coverage into a failure. `ucf_theme_a11y_assert_blocks_covered()` in the
